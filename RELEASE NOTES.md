# Release Notes

### 2.0.5
#### January 9, 2023

* Many UI changes:
  * STYLE knob is smaller, elements moved.
  * Now have nine INx ports instead of six.
  * The minimum width is now one “hole” smaller, and this hides the editing window.
  * Can enter a title for a module (via the menu) that shows up above the IN ports. Handy for stating what role the module plays in the patch.
  * Added menu option to change the status light from green/red to blue/orange.
  * And added new screen color options.
* [Added ‘elseif’](https://github.com/mahlenmorris/VCVRack/blob/main/README.md#if-statements-conditional-behavior). E.g., “IF a == 5 THEN … ELSEIF a == 4 THEN … “
* Added methods about the environment, [sample_rate() and connected()](https://github.com/mahlenmorris/VCVRack/blob/main/README.md#setting-and-using-variables-assignment-and-math).
* Added methods for random number generation, [random() and normal()](https://github.com/mahlenmorris/VCVRack/blob/main/README.md#setting-and-using-variables-assignment-and-math).
* Added [single dimension arrays](https://github.com/mahlenmorris/VCVRack/blob/main/README.md#arrays), and a simple way to set a range of values.

### 2.0.4
#### December 19, 2022
Updates to BASICally:
* Rejiggered UI elements.
* The first line that confuses BASICally will be highlighted in red. This behavior can be turned off in the menu.
