# The Memory modules for VCV Rack
A set of related modules for use with VCV Rack 2.0. They combine to form systems of
recording and playback of audio. Forms an inverted tape machine, with a motionless
recording medium (a Memory) and playback and recording heads that move independently within it.

* [Memory](#memory): The module upon which audio is recorded and played from. Can be wiped clean
and resized. *Always* the left-most module in a Memory system.
* [Depict](#depict): Visualizes the contents of the Memory and the movement of the heads within it.
* [Embellish](#embellish): Records stereo signals sent to it, but simultaneously plays back the 
audio signal under the head. This makes sound-on-sound, effects passes, and the building up of 
sound over time straighforward.
* [Ruminate](#ruminate): Plays back audio at a large variety of speeds.
