Notes on conversion to a reentrant Flex scanner.

By adding '%option reentrant':
- All of the Flex globals (of which there are many) have been wrapped into
   a struct called yyguts_t (defined around line 752 of scanner.cc).
- Many methods seem to have access (how?) to a yyguts_t* called 'yyscanner'.
- The most important of these _might_ be yylex, which is defined by defining
  YY_DECL, which is defined by me
  in driver.hh. It seems to be the first call, at least.
- It's possible that yylex is a REALLY long function.
- Why is the parser.cc convinced that yylex is called with 'drv' as an argument?
Ah, it's the %param setting in parser.yy. Better to separate them into the
%parse-param and %lex-param settings.
- OK, parser works again, now I need to get scanner working.
- Done!
