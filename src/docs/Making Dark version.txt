Notes on how to change a light version of a .svg file into a dark version.


Background plate change from e8f1f2ff to 201e1eff.
Black print (which may not have a set color) get Fill color set to edededff.
Exclamation goes from alpha = FF to alpha = (hex)81.
Any text written on the panel changes color. E.g., from BASICally, 
          nvgFillColor(args.vg, settings::preferDarkPanels ? color::WHITE :
                                                             color::BLACK);
