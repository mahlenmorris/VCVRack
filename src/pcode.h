/*
The structures that make up the pseudocode that gets run during a call
to process(). Needs to be:
* interruptible and efficient, because process() isn't allowed to run for long
* always have a position (e.g., line number) that we can pick up execution at.
The Line's that the Parser created are turned into these instructions.
For some Line types, this means simply embedding them in the PCode (e.g.,
ASSIGN, WAIT).
For structural Line types (IFTHEN, FORTO), we need to decompose the Line
into jumps and conditional jumps, so that the Lines embedded within the
structure are properly flattened into the whole program.
